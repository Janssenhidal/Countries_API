## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vue JS
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- Git

### What I learned

Overall in this project I have learned a lot of new valuable things, some of which are the ability to use Vuex, auto-search completion and filtering a list.

### Continued development

The use of local-storage to save the user's theme colour's preference. 

### Useful resources

- [Auto-Search Completion](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vue-autocomplete-component) - This helped to learn how to make use of some Vue properties but also how to create an auto-search completion component.
